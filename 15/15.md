15 : Water Reaches Consistent Level

Summary: A container with water and various weirdly shaped cavities in it, demonstrates water will find level regardless of shape/pressure is a function of depth, not volume.
Alternative might be to demonstrate how pressure varies with flow velocity, but making a self  contained and tidy  demo with a venturi restriction could be hard.
