### [01 : Magnetic Newton's Cradle](01/01.md)
Summary: 4 or 5 pendulums with opposing magnets for heads, demosntration of conservation of energy

### [02 : EM Levitator](02/02.md)
Summary: with a little battery pack and solenoid, levitate a ring when a button is pushed.

### [03 : Fluid Separation](03/03.md)
Summary: A container with two or three immiscible fluids that have distinctive visual nature and densities.

### [04 : Hand powered flash light](04/04.md)
Summary: A simple off the shelf hand cranked flash light demonstrates how mechanical effort can be turned into electrical power.

### [05 : Wind Paddle Wheel](05/05.md)
Summary: A hand operated bellows/squeeze bulb and a one-way valve can be used to generate flow that runs past a simple paddle wheel, demonstrating how linear flows can be transformed into rotational movement

### [06 : Two Lens Telescope](06/06.md)
Summary: One lens locked in place, a second lens that can be moved along the axis and settled in one of a few notches, one of the notches configured so the telescope is properly focused on infinite.

### [07 : Tornado Bottle](07/07.md)
Summary: A pair of bottles with enough water to fill one to about 75%, the channel between them is too narrow for simple flow, but a spin can set up a vortex from one to the other. Offers an oppurtunity to talk about flows and vorticity/curl.

### [08 : Comparisons of a Mol](08/08.md)
Summary: A few metals, maybe iron, tin, aluminum, copper, each present in one mol's quantity to demonstrate density or atomic mass, or just the quantity of avogadro's number.

### [09 : Angular Momentum Demo](09/09.md)
Summary: A top that can have arms extend further from the center to make it's angular momentum increase substantially. Not sure how to make it configurable. Demonstrates how the configuration of mass can significantly impact the properties of an object.

### [10 : Prism Breaking up Light](10/10.md)
Summary: A basic prism breaking up sunlight into rainbow, probably a slit between the light source (likely the sun) and the prism to improve the signal interpretation.

### [11 : Photoelectric Effect](11/11.md)
Summary: A device where the power switch is a PV panel that defaults to having a lid over it, when exposed the panel sends power to a transistor turning on whatever active state is, maybe a little spinny wheel or the like.

### [12 : Phase Change Demo](12/12.md)
Summary: As every table will have ice water and human bodies, a material that transitions from liquid to solid in the range between 0 and 30 c would be able to reliably made to switch. Demonstrates phase changes and reversible processes.

### [13 : Something With Pistons](13/13.md)
Summary: I don't know, piston/syringes are neat and would be one way to demo ideal gas law consequences/mechanical advantage.

### [14 : Levers](14/14.md)
Summary: A pair of levers both acting on the same mass on a rail. One lever gives a lot of torque avantage and the other lever gives very little torque advantage. Demonstrates the trade off between effect size and force multiplication. May be tricky to get both levers to engage reliably.

### [15 : Water Reaches Consistent Level](15/15.md)
Summary: A container with water and various weirdly shaped cavities in it, demonstrates water will find level regardless of shape/pressure is a function of depth, not volume.

### [16 : Extra Low Frequency Moter](16/16.md)
Summary: Dissassemble an off the shelf motor and wire LED's into the coils to show when each coil is being energized. Drive at very low frequency and have it actuate an arrow to show how it's moving in time with the LEDs.

### [17 : Magnetic Gear](17/17.md)
Summary: A pair of magnetic gears/coupling devices that are separated by an air gap but still engage with each other to demonstrate torque transmission doesn't require physical contact

### [18 : Laser Based Selective Transmission](18/18.md)
Summary: A laser on a swivel mount that can go be aimed at two different pieces of celophane, one that's opaque to that wavelength of light and one that isn't. Demonstrates how selective filters exist.

### [19 : Resonating oscillators](19/19.md)
Summary: pendulums on a shared platform with some give will couple together if they have complimentary frequencies

### [20 : Double Pendulum](20/20.md)
Summary: One simple pendulum suspended from the bottom of another simple pendulum generates a system that is chaotic at large displacements from equilibrium

### [21 : Static Magnetic Levitation](21/21.md)
Summary: A toy (plane, boat, action figure what have) has a magnet placed on it's dorsal side and a string attached to its ventral side. An overhanging magnet on a scaffold is positioned so that the string doesn't quite let the two magnets touch, but the strength of the attraction over powers gravity so the toy floats.
