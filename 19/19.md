Summary: pendulums on a shared platform with some give will couple together if they have complimentary frequencies

This will require a base that can hold the shifting platform which holds the pendulums.

easiest pendulum might be a simple wood dowel (chop sticks?) with a washer or two as the base weight that are freely swinging on a nail between two dowels or small planks acting as columns. Or even a frame that all the dowels go through.

the base platform would just have two colums on opposite sides with the pendulum platform suspended by say, rubber bands. Alternatively loose springs might be used.
