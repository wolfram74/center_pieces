20 : Double Pendulum

Summary: 
	One simple pendulum suspended from the bottom of another simple pendulum generates a system that is chaotic at large displacements from equilibrium

	Using a distribution of weight of at both ends of a beam with pivot point in the center, a much longer period can be attained for more observable behavior.

	First holes drilled were 1/8, pivot points widened to 9/64
	primary pendulum of 16 cm with a counter weight of .8
	secondary pendulum of 12 cm with a counter weight of .85
	should have similar periods
