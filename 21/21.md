21 : Static Magnetic Levitation

Summary: A toy (plane, boat, action figure what have) has a magnet placed on it's dorsal side and a string attached to its ventral side. An overhanging magnet on a scaffold is positioned so that the string doesn't quite let the two magnets touch, but the strength of the attraction over powers gravity so the toy floats.
